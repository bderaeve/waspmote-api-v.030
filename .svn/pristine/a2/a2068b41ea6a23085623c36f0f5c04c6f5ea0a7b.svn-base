/*
writestream: Setup the SRAM in sequential write mode starting from the passed address.
             Bytes can then be written one byte at a time using RWdata(byte data).
			 Each byte is stored in the next location and it wraps around 32767.

readstream:  Setup the SRAM in sequential read mode starting from the passed address.
             Bytes can then be read one byte at a time using  byte RWdata(0).The passed data is irrelavent.
			 Each byte is read from the next location and it wraps around 32767.

RWdata:      Write or read a byte at any time from the SRAM.
             If the writesteam is open the passed byte will be written to the current address.
			 If the readstream is open the byte from the current address will be returned.

closeRWstream: Use to close the  open read or write stream.
               Dont need when changing between read/write.
			   Close before using SPI somewhere else.
